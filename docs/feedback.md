Got it — here’s a crisp, English summary of all UX feedback captured across the wireframe review and dailies. I grouped each item as “What to change” + a short UX rationale, with citations to the exact moments in the transcripts.

| #  | Feedback                                       | What to change                                                                                                                                    | UX rationale (why)                                                                            | Source |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 1  | Make initial sync transparent                  | Only show a “Syncing…” screen with a progress bar when the day isn’t synced; otherwise skip straight to the app. Decide via last-sync check.      | Reduces friction and perceived wait; “visibility of system status” without blocking the flow. |        |
| 2  | Main screen = ordered client list              | First screen must be a sorted list to visit; visited items drop from “Pending.”                                                                   | Makes today’s work obvious; supports scanning; minimizes navigation.                          |        |
| 3  | Priority coding by color (and optional number) | Group clients by priority (e.g., quintiles) using color; optional small number if it helps—but order on screen is the true sequence.              | Preattentive color cues aid prioritization; avoids overloading with numbers.                  |        |
| 4  | Keep flows ultra-simple                        | Favor fewer screens; don’t expose technical/debug info during sync.                                                                               | Fewer steps = lower error risk and faster task completion.                                    |        |
| 5  | Remove “Registrar feedback” button             | Make each recommendation list item the tappable control to open its detail.                                                                       | Reduces extra taps; leverages obvious list affordance.                                        |        |
| 6  | Use local wording (“Resultados”)               | Replace the term “feedback” with user-friendly Spanish like “Resultados.”                                                                         | Domain language improves comprehension and adoption.                                          |        |
| 7  | Structured responses over free text            | For outcomes (Aceptado / Rechazado / Parcial) and reasons (incl. promotions), provide 3–4 predefined options; keep a small “Nota (opcional).”     | Faster in the field; far more analyzable than open text; optional note preserves nuance.      |        |
| 8  | Clarify save behavior                          | Keep an explicit Save (and Back/Cancel) when needed; otherwise, committing via the primary action should auto-save and show a brief confirmation. | Gives users control/confirmation; reduces accidental loss.                                    |        |
| 9  | Streamline visit completion                    | One “Finalizar visita” action; show a short “visit recorded” toast then return to list—no separate “summary” screen.                              | Cuts dead-end screens; keeps momentum between visits.                                         |        |
| 10 | Focus client detail on essentials              | Remove map/address and placeholder “Resumen/KPIs” blocks; show Recommendations and Reason for visit (reason can live below).                      | Reduces noise; keeps attention on the task at hand.                                           |        |
| 11 | Show recommendation count & scroll             | Indicate “Recomendaciones: N” and allow scrolling if they don’t all fit.                                                                          | Sets expectations; prevents hidden content.                                                   |        |
| 12 | Keep inventory capture inside client           | Don’t send users to separate modules from the list; the inventory/stock items should be accessible within the selected client’s flow.             | Minimizes context switching and extra clicks.                                                 |        |
| 13 | Unify “Quiebre de stock” with Inventory        | Treat “No hay” (stockout) as the lowest level within the inventory scale (No hay/Bajo/Medio/Alto), with a quick dialog for the reason.            | One mental model; fewer screens; faster reporting.                                            |        |
| 14 | Market Intelligence = four sections            | Ensure the MI area covers 4 sections: Quiebre de stock, Inventario propio, Inventario competencia, Ejecución & Visibilidad.                       | Matches the planned scope and stakeholders’ expectations.                                     |        |
| 15 | Promotions: predefined capture                 | Add a small dialog to record active promotions with fixed options (not free text).                                                                | Faster input; clean reporting downstream.                                                     |        |
| 16 | Recommendations must include the “why”         | Each recommendation should show the explicit reason (“Cliente con 2 semanas sin compra…”) so advisors can justify it.                             | Builds trust and supports conversation with the client.                                       |        |
| 17 | Photo evidence (consider)                      | Stakeholder suggested capturing photographic evidence for some items (e.g., visibilidad/refrigeradores).                                          | Improves data quality; supports later audits—optional for pilot.                              |        |
| 18 | Geofencing feedback                            | If a visit is recorded outside the client geofence, alert the user and allow correction; log actual capture location.                             | Prevents data errors; keeps the pilot data reliable.                                          |        |

### Notes aligning with the implementation plan

* The “sync progress bar” and “last-sync gating” directly map to WP1.5 (“Initial Sync”) and its pending acceptance criteria (progress %, error handling, offline state). This feedback is consistent with what’s flagged as missing. 

If you’d like, I can turn this into a living checklist (with owners and status) or map each item to screens/components (e.g., ClientList, ClientDetail, RecommendationCard, SyncScreen) for dev handoff.
